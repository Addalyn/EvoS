# Directory Server

This  project is the directory server, in the original server it was the server that do the player's account authentication and also it acts as a load balancer so after a successful login the player was assigned to an available lobby server depending on the region it was playing

In out case this server is only in charge of giving the player the ip of the lobby server without doing any authentication at all
